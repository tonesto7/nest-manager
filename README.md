## Things to Know

 * Each install of this SmartApp will only support **One** location/structure and the Thermostats and Protects within
 * This version uses a new token which when we are ready to support it will allow access to Nest cams without needing to completely re-install everything.
 * _The token used with this application is using my 'Works for Nest' distribution *appId* and *secret*.  It's an older one which allows 1000 individual user logins before I will need to certify with Nest._
 __I do not have the ability to see any of your data or who is even using the token__
 * Devices that use html tile will not refresh with going out of the device and back in again.

## Advantages
 * Able to add/remove multiples devices from a single SmartApp
 * No need to many enter device serial number and login info in preferences
 * Nest Login info is not stored by the application
 * No need to use 3rd Party Polling apps for device updates
 * One single API call for all Nest devices
 * Since there is only a single poll for all devices, updates are more often
 * The devices look great :smile:
