# Nest Manager (Unofficial)

#####IMPORTANT: **There were a ton of changes to the core code so we can't guarantee that you will not have any issues when updating the code directly from v1.1.  Once you update to code it is very important that you open the Nest Manager smart-app and press 'Done' to clean up old variables and switch to using the new Cron scheduler.  If you have any issues after that I suggest you remove the old devices from any Apps, Routines, or Rules they are being used with, and then remove the Nest Manager smart-app and start over fresh.**

### Nest Manager App
This is the "***unofficial***" SmartThings user created SmartApp and Device handlers.
The SmartApp and Device Handlers work together to provide integration to the SmartThings ecosystem using Nest's Official API.

## Version Info
__Latest App Version:__ 

* Nest Manager - __*v2.0.8*__
* Nest Automations - __*v1.2.2*__

__Latest Device Versions:__

* Nest Presence Device - __*v2.0.2*__
* Nest Protect Device - __*v2.0.2*__
* Nest Thermostat Device - __*v2.0.3*__
* Nest Weather Device - __*v1.1.1*__

## What's New
 * **NEW**: In-app HTML help pages
 * **NEW**: All new polling logic (Also switched to Cron scheduling)
 * **NEW**: Support for sending commands from multiple devices by using Queuing of commands to help prevent being rate-limited by Nest. (Thanks @E_sch)
 * **NEW**: Custom device naming during new device installs. 
 * **UPDATED**:Fresh device tile designs :smile: (These may cause some controversy and be asked to be reverted back) (On first load of the device it may take a few seconds to render the tiles)
 * **NEW**: Weather Device that will be updated with the rest of the devices so using a polling app to update the weather is no longer necessary. (Thanks @desertblade)
 * **NEW**: Nest Automation Child (BETA) app as a place to turn thermostats off based on contacts open/closed, outside weather temps, and remote sensor support.   
 * **UPDATED**: Much more transparent error handling during the install process. The App will alert you in the app with a push notification and very clearly in the live logs in the IDE.  
 	It performs tests on the following:
	 * Verify's that OAuth is enabled for the SmartApp
	 * The Device Handlers are installed and published
	 * That your SmartThings account contains a proper Zip-Code.
	 * When uninstalling it will notify you that it can't remove the devices because they are being used by other apps/routines.  
 
 * There are also way to many subtle changes to list.

## Things to Know
 * __This is still technically in still in post-BETA so you may experience issues!!!__
 * This app ***DOES NOT*** support Nest Cams **currently** mainly because I don't have any to test
 * Each install of this SmartApp will only support **One** location/structure and the Thermostats and Protects within
 * This version uses a new token which when we are ready to support it will allow access to Nest cams without needing to completely re-install everything. 
 * _The token used with this application is using my 'Works for Nest' distribution *appId* and *secret*.  It's an older one which allows 1000 individual user logins before I will need to certify with Nest._
 __I do not have the ability to see any of your data or who is even using the token__
 * Devices that use html tile will not refresh with going out of the device and back in again.
 
 *  ***There were a ton of changes to the core code so we can't guarantee there won't issue updating the code directly.  Once you update it is important that you open the smart app and press done to clean up old variables and switch to the new Cron scheduler.  If you have any issues after that I suggest you remove the old devices from any apps or routines they are under. Then remove the nest manager smartapp and start over.***


## Advantages
 * Able to add/remove multiples devices from a single SmartApp
 * No need to many enter device serial number and login info in preferences
 * Nest Login info is not stored by the application
 * No need to use 3rd Party Polling apps for device updates
 * One single API call for all Nest devices
 * Since there is only a single poll for all devices, updates are more often
 * The devices look great :smile:

## 3rd-Party SmartApp Compatibility (Confirmed)

## Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issues
*If you are experiencing any issues, please let us know by heading over to projects issues page on GitHub. If you don't see the issue reported please help open an new one and provide as much detail as you can.*

**[Project Issues Link](https://github.com/tonesto7/st-nest-unofficial/issues)** 

In an effort to make it easier for some of you troubleshoot without having to use the IDE constantly.  I have added in a diagnostic option under the preference section of the SmartApp.  
Once this is enabled it will begin to store non-user identifiable error logs from the app and store in a local state variable of the app.  
This feature will help you to view and export the logs (*also see the tip below*) directly from the Smart App. This also allows you to copy & paste them into the issues form on GitHub.

**Tip:** If you enable diagnostic logs in the app you can share the logs from with in the app you can store the direct link to log JSON file on you computer and browse directly to the log everytime you need to review the errors.

### Troubleshooting
**Tip:** *The most common issue is forgetting to enable oAuth for the app under SmartThings*
